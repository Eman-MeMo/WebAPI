I made 3 Projects contact with each other using API

1- WebAPI Implementation (Backend API):
    This project serves as the backend for your system. It defines data classes and functions using the Code-First approach, which means you've likely defined your data models as C# classes and generated a database schema from them.
    You've built API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These endpoints allow the Windows Forms Application and ASP.NET Web App to interact with your data and perform operations on it.


2- Windows Forms Application (Desktop Application):
    This desktop application provides a user interface for interacting with your API. Users can perform various actions on your data, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
    The application communicates with your API by making HTTP requests to the API's endpoints. These requests are typically in the form of GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to retrieve data from or send data to the API.

3- ASP.NET Web App using AJAX (Web Application):
    This web application is designed for user interaction via web pages. It utilizes AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to make asynchronous requests to your API.
    AJAX allows web pages to send and receive data from the API without requiring the entire page to be refreshed. This provides a smoother and more responsive user experience.
